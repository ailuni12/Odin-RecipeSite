        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These delicious, fluffy pancakes are a version of the pancakes my dad used to make for us girls when we were
            little. This version is now a Sunday morning favorite of my daughter.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture.
                Whisk until well blended.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by 1/4 cup measures onto the griddle and cook
                until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side,
                2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
